      <ul>
        <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
        <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
        <li>HTML attribute defines additional info about an element and is always in the beginning</li>
        <li>metadata is data about the webpage that browser uses to effectively serve webpage to users</li>
        <li>Elements nested inside other elements are child elements, parent element holds them all</li>

      <li>h1-h6 are headings, start with h1</li>

  <h2>CSS</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
  <li>A padding inidicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
  <li>Incline CSS: used to style an element directly in HTML file, to specific tag. Useful for quick and permanent changes, but less flexible</li>
  <li>Internal Style Sheet: HTML directly using style element in the head element</li>
  <li>External CSS style sheet: most common option and allows rules in separate file to make design changes easier. Link said file using link element in HTML head</li>
  <li>CSS Rule-Selector: defines element or attributes which rules or declarations will apply</li>
  <li>CSS RUle-declarations: CSS property, such as color, and the value of that property, ex.blue</li>
  <li>*: selector to make a rule for all elements on page</li>
  <li>Class attributes: a way for CSS declarations to add styles to only certain elements</li>
  <li>Use period before class attribute to designate it as a class selector</li>

    <h2>Git</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
      <li>git checkout -b branch name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
      <li>git commit -m: commit staged changes to repository, the -m flag is to associate a message with our commit</li>
      <li>git pull origin main: pull in the base branch</li>
      <li>git push origin *insert feature branch here*: push up all of our changes</li>
      <li>-A flag indicates we want to add all changes</li>
      <li>ls: list of directories and files</li>

  <h2>JavaScript</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code</li>
    <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script</li>
    <li>Const keyword allows us to create variables that can't be reassigned value</li>
    <li>let keyword allows us to reassign values</li>
    <li>console.log method allows us to output message to web console by adding an argument</li>
    <li>Right click and select inspect, then select console tab to see console/log method in action</li>
    <li>script.js is linked within body element of HTML</li>
    <li>If Statement: Code will only execute if statement meets a condition or is true</li>
    <li>Falsy = 0, -0, "", null, undefined, NaN, Boolean false. Truthy = everything else</li>
    <li>Array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data, typically data is related in some way, but can hold different types of data</li>
    <li>Array Index is the location of data inside an array with a unique number to access inidividual data points. In JavaScript zero-indexed and sequential</li>
    <li>A for loop uses sequential pattern of indices to perform task on all items in array, this allows single code block to be executed over and over</li>
    <li>A for loop has 3 important statements: starting point of loop ex)let x = 0; condition statement x being less than array length ex) x < shapes.length; and the final statement which allows it to iterate and increase by one ex)x++</li>
    <li>A function is a set of intructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task</li>
    <li>Functions do not automatically execute, must call a function by name to do so</li>
    <li>To declare a function write function, then give it a unique name and include paranthesis right after, within curly brackets write code that should be run</li>
